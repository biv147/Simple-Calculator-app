This is an attempt for a simple calcular app

Functionality:
-Takes in 2 numbers
-Allows the user to choose if they want to add/subtract/multiply/divide
-Returns the result

Bugs:
-Application quits if any button is pressed before numbers are entered
-Divide button stays on the bottom right (unable to move it due to some unknown reason)
